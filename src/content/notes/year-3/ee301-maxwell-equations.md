# Maxwell's Equations

A comprehensive study of the four fundamental equations of electromagnetism.

## The Four Equations

1. **Gauss's Law for Electricity**
   - ∇ · E = ρ/ε₀
   - Electric field divergence

2. **Gauss's Law for Magnetism**
   - ∇ · B = 0
   - No magnetic monopoles

3. **Faraday's Law**
   - ∇ × E = -∂B/∂t
   - Electromagnetic induction

4. **Ampère-Maxwell Law**
   - ∇ × B = μ₀J + μ₀ε₀∂E/∂t
   - Displacement current

## Applications

- Wave propagation
- Antenna design
- Waveguides
